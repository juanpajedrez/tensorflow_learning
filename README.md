# Tensorflow Learning

Welcome to my TensorFlow learning repository! Here, I document my progress with various notebooks and projects highlighting TensorFlowâ€™s capabilities and exploring its fundamentals.

The repository is organized into sections:

Fundamental Concepts: A series of Jupyter notebooks focused on learning and mastering the foundational elements of TensorFlow.
Applied Projects: Practical projects showcasing my application of TensorFlow to solve diverse challenges and real-world problems.
This repository is a work in progress. I'll update the README and content as I continue on this journey.

### Fundamental Concepts Notebooks
- Notebook 1:
  * tensors definitions for 1D, 2D, and 3D, boolean, string, shape and dimensions
  * tensorflow functions for tensor creation: zeros, ones, ones_like, identity_matrix
  * tensorflow casting from numpy
  * tensors creation from random distributions: random normal, uniform, random.set_seet
- Notebook 2:
  * tensorflow and mathematical operations: absolute, power, maximum, minimum, argmin, argmax
  * tensorflow broadcasting from 1D, 2D, and 3D
  * tensorflow math useful functions: reduce_sum, reduce_max, reduce_mean
  * tensorflow linalg operations: matmul, matrix multiplication, transpose.
  * tensorflow bandpart definition of upper, lower, and normal diagonal in a matrix
