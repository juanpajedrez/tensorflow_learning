# Tensorflow Learning

Welcome to my TensorFlow learning repository! Here, I document my progress with various notebooks and projects that highlight TensorFlow’s capabilities and explore its fundamentals.

The repository is organized into sections:

Fundamental Concepts: A series of Jupyter notebooks focused on learning and mastering the foundational elements of TensorFlow.
Applied Projects: Practical projects showcasing my application of TensorFlow to solve diverse challenges and real-world problems.
This repository is a work in progress. I'll update the README and content as I continue on this journey.

### Fundamental Concepts Notebooks
- Notebook 1:
   * tensors definitions for 1D, 2D, and 3D, boolean, string, shape and dimensions
   * tensorflow functions for tensor creation: zeros, ones, ones_like, identity_matrix
   * tensorflow casting from numpy
   * tensors creation from random distributions: random normal, uniform, random.set_seet
- Notebook 2:
   * tensorflow and mathematical operations: absolute, power, maximum, minimum, argmin, argmax
   * tensorflow broadcasting from 1D, 2D, and 3D
   * tensorflow math useful functions: reduce_sum, reduce_max, reduce_mean
   * tensorflow linalg operations: matmul, matrix multiplication, transpose.
   * tensorflow bandpart definition of upper, lower, and normal diagonal in a matrix
   * SVD and inverse of a square matrix using tensorflow
 - Notebook 3:
   * Numpy 2D and 3D operations using einsum
   * Key and Query multiplication from attention transformers example
   * Efficient transformer chunks from present and past using einsum example.
 - Notebook 4:
   * Tensorflow important functions, expand dimensions for 1D, 2D, 3D
   * Tensorflow squeeze dimensions for 2D and 3D tensors.
   * Tensorflow reshape method for 2D and 3D tensors.
   * Tensorflow concatanetion for 2D and 3D tensors.
   * Tensorflow stack for 2D and 3D tensors, and difference with concatenation.
   * Tensorflow gather, gather_nd, and padding method
 - Notebook 5::
   * Tensorflow ragged tensors implementations.
   * Create ragged tensors using from_row_lengths, from_row_limits, from_row_splits.
   * Explored the usage of tensors containing strings, and see how there are analyzed
