# Tensorflow Learning

Welcome to my TensorFlow learning repository! Here, I document my progress with various notebooks and projects that highlight TensorFlowâ€™s capabilities and my exploration of its fundamentals.

The repository is organized into sections:

Fundamental Concepts: A series of Jupyter notebooks focused on learning and mastering the foundational elements of TensorFlow.
Applied Projects: Practical projects showcasing my application of TensorFlow to solve diverse challenges and real-world problems.
This repository is a work in progress, and I'll be updating the README and content as I continue on this journey.

All of the different jupyter notebooks and projects are based on this complete course of tensorflow:
